# GAN-Project
This project was made based on a YouTube video by Nicholas Renotte https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AALBGpLbj6Q. This YouTube tutorial uses the MNIST Fashion dataset. 

To deepen my understanding of the code and implementation of GAN after finishing the tutorial, I decided to reimplement the GAN with a different dataset, that being the Pokemon Dataset from the user kvpratama. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset

## Getting Started
Open the project in CoLab and run the file. 
### Prerequisites
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- matplotlib
- ipywidgets
### Future Work
- Deploy on Hugging Face
- Explore other types of GAN's like Conditional GAN's
